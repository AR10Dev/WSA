# WSA (also includes Google Play Services and Magisk)

> ⚠️ Note: This repository is designed specifically not to be forked. This does not use the same mechanism as the original MagiskOnWSA, as the original mechanism is slow and unreliable, and also violates GitHub's Terms of Service due to abuse of GitHub Actions in forks. Don't fork this repository unless you're a developer and want to modify the code itself or want to download a specific configuration of WSA not already available in the [Releases page](https://github.com/AR10Dev/WSA/releases/latest).

## Installation

> Note: If you have the official WSA installed, you must [completely uninstall](#uninstallation) it to use WSA

1. Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/AR10Dev/WSA/releases/latest)
2. In the latest release, go to the Assets section and download the WSA version of your choosing (do not download "Source code")
3. Extract the zip file
4. Delete the zip file
5. Move the newly extracted folder to a suitable location (Documents folder is a good choice), as you will need to keep the folder on your PC to use WSA
> Note: If you're updating WSA, merge the folders and replace the files for all items when asked

6. Open the WSA folder and double-click `Run.bat`
7. Once the installation process completes, WSA will launch (if this is a first-time install, a window asking for consent to diagnositic information will be shown instead. Sometimes two identical windows will show, this is fine and nothing bad happens if you click OK in both windows)
8. Click on the PowerShell window, then press any key on the keyboard, the PowerShell window should close
9. Close File Explorer

## Uninstallation

> Note: If you want to preseve your data, make a backup of the `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\MicrosoftCorporationII.WindowsSubsystemForAndroid_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalCache\userdata.vhdx` file. After uninstalling, copy the VHDX file back to the `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\MicrosoftCorporationII.WindowsSubsystemForAndroid_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalCache` folder.

1. Go to the Start Menu
2. Type `Windows Subsystem for Android`
3. Once the WSA app shows, click `App settings` in the right pane
4. In the Settings window that opens, scroll down and click `Terminate`
5. Click `Repair`
6. Click `Reset`
7. Close the Settings app
8. Go to the Start Menu
9. Type `Windows Subsystem for Android`

## Help

How do I get a logcat?

- `adb logcat`

or

- `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\MicrosoftCorporationII.WindowsSubsystemForAndroid_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\diagnostics\logcat`

How do I update Magisk?

- Wait for a new WSA release that includes the newer Magisk version, then follow the [Installation instructions](#installation) to update

Can I pass SafetyNet/Play Integrity?

- No. Virtual machines like WSA cannot pass these mechanisms on their own due to the lack of signing by Google. Passing requires more exotic (and untested) solutions: <https://github.com/kdrag0n/safetynet-fix/discussions/145#discussioncomment-2170917>

What is virtualization?

- Virtualization is required to run virtual machines like WSA. `Run.bat` helps you enable it. After rebooting, re-run `Run.bat` to install WSA. If it's still not working, you have to enable virtualization in your BIOS/UEFI. Instructions vary by PC vendor, look for help online

Can I remount system partition as read-write?

- No. WSA is mounted as read-only by Hyper-V. You can, however, modify the system partition by creating a Magisk module, or by directly modifying the system.img file

How do I uninstall Magisk?

- Download a WSA version that doesn't include Magisk from the [Releases page](https://github.com/AR10Dev/WSA/releases/latest). Then follow the [Installation instructions](#installation)

Can I switch between OpenGApps and MindTheGapps?

- No. GApps will no longer function. Do a [complete uninstallation](#uninstallation) before switching
